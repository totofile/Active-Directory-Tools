# Active Directory List Group and Object In CSV 
## This PowerShell script is to run on an Active Directory

This PowerShell script automates the process of exporting user information from Active Directory groups to CSV files. 
## Prerequisites
Before running this script, ensure you have the following:
- **CSV File**: You need to have a CSV file named `groups.csv` containing a list of group names for which you want to retrieve information. There is an exambple file in the repo.
Here's what it does:
1. **Module Check:** It checks if the Active Directory module needed is installed. If not, it installs it automatically.
2. **Folder Creation:** It creates "Export" and "Log" folders in the script directory if they don't exist already.
3. **CSV File Processing:** It specifies the CSV file containing group information and processes each group listed.
4. **User Export:** For each group, it retrieves users and nested groups, then exports their information to a new CSV file named with a timestamp.
5. **Logging:** It logs the export process, indicating which groups have been processed and where the corresponding CSV files are stored.
6. **Output Display:** Finally, it displays the log file content to the user.

- **UPN (User Principal Name)**: The user's unique identifier in the Active Directory domain.
- **FullName**: The full name of the user.
